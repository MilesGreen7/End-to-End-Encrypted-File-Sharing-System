# This repository contains my end-to-end encrypted file sharing system

For comprehensive documentation, see the spec (https://sp23.cs161.org/proj2/) or look at the design document pdf for a comprehensive walkthrough of my implementation.

My implementation is in `client/client.go`, and my tests are in `client_test/client_test.go`.

To test my implementation, run `go test -v` inside of the `client_test` directory.
